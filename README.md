# Deep Learning Forecast & Reinforcement Learning Framework

This project is designed to streamline the creation and training of deep learning (DL) models for forecasting and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks.

## Usage

Run the following command:

python run.py --type [RL or DL] --mode [train or test] --config_name [name_of_toml_files]

- --type: Select between RL (Reinforcement Learning) or DL (Deep Learning for Forecasting)
- --mode: Choose 'train' to train a model, or 'test' to evaluate a model
- --config_name: Name of the TOML configuration files to use (located in configs/), you can use several files

## Important Note

The Reinforcement Learning (RL) part is not functional yet. Development is in progress.
